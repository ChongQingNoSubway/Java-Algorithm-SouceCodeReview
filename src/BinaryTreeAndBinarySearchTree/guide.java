//Binary tree
// definition : at most two children node.


//class TreeNode {
//    int value;
//    TreeNode left;
//    TreeNode right;
//    TreeNode parent;
//}

// trick : base case usually refer to null childnode below the leaf node.
//  Balanced Binary tree:  is commonly defied as a binary tree in which the depth of the left and  right
// subtree  of every node differ by 1 or less.

// Complete binary tree:
// is a binary tree in which every , except possible the last , is complete filled, and all nodes are as far as left as possible.

// Binary Search Tree: For every single node in the tree, the value in its left subtree are smaller than it value,
// and the value in its right subtree are all larger than it value.
